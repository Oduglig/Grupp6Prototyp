  - 
  - 'Ah, so you''ve awoken at last. Tell me, what do you remember? Hm, not really
    much of anything at all, it would seem. '
  - Let's just call you The Protagonist, for now. You may refer to me as The Narrator...
    or just a strange voice inside your head, if that's what you prefer.
  - Now, the question is, Protagonist, where in the world might you be? Is it some
    sort of a bizarre castle, or perhaps a dungeon?
  - Alas, due to your complete lack of knowledge, all you can really do now is try
    to proceed onward.
  - While it remains an unfortunate fact that you currently lack the slightest fragment
    of knowledge about... well, anything,
  - 'you''re fortunate enough to be accompanied by me: enlightenment incarnate.'
  - I may share some tidbits of comprehension on occasion, if I feel up to it.
  - Now here's one tidbit for you... You are indeed trapped in a dungeon.
  - This expansive dungeon happens to be located right underneath a most grandiose
    castle, however, so your first guess was not entirely erroneous either.
  - I suppose it's time for another tidbit of comprehension, yes? The world outside
    these walls is most astounding.
  - Now, what exactly does that mean? It means that you should strive with your entire
    being to escape this place and find out for yourself.
  - Oh, a tad bit cheeky, aren't I?
  - 'A most exquisite piece of art, is it not? It depicts the former master of this
    castle, in his current form. '
  - "While he was once the most distinguished and noble gentleman imaginable, he\u2019s
    now been reduced to a mere rodent. You may have also noticed him in the cell
    next to yours. "
  - Perhaps I should tell you a bit more about the former master? I, The Narrator,
    was in fact a humble and loyal servant of said master.
  - 'When that vile sorcerer, who is now the current master, brought his downfall,
    he also reduced me to this: a wise but most pathetic spirit, cursed to eternally
    roam these halls.'
  - 'Now this is a statue overflowing with memories of The Saint. '
  - Those memories are powerful, though precisely how they will decide to manifest
    themselves for you, Protagonist, is... uncertain.
  - Alas, due to the blessing of The Saint, it would seem not even death will release
    you from this accursed place.
  - I suppose by now you may be wondering who, or what, The Saint actually is. Tragically,
    no one even remembers her name anymore. She is said to have been the most noble
    and pure soul of all.
  - Perhaps she was, or was she perhaps an evil entity who cursed innocent bypassers
    like yourself with eternal life? For once, I'm afraid I really do not know the
    answer.
  - "Oh, if it isn\u2019t a statue depicting the former master\u2019s majestic visage,
    prior to his\u2026 transformation."
  - "There is one thing I\u2019ve been hesitating to ask of you, Protagonist. Would
    you be willing to try and bring him down? The current master, Emericus, that
    is."
  - "\u2018Tis an immense request indeed, but your adept navigation through this
    place thus far has been enough to bring this old spirit\u2026 hope."
  - "It seems like this is the end, for now. I do hope that you\u2019ll help me bring
    Emericus down, but if you\u2019d rather leave this dungeon behind you once and
    for all and escape\u2026 I truly wouldn\u2019t blame you."
  - Oh my, a hidden room, eh? Don't mind any graphical artifacts, please.
  - Oh no, it would seem greed would be your downfall, Protagonist.
